# Contributing

This is a community project where every contribution is appreciated!

There is a simple process to follow no matter if you are facing an bug, have an
idea, or simply have a question.

## Process of issue filing

Check if there is an existing issue covering your intention.

1. if you have the same problem but the outcome is different (or vice versa),
   add a comment stating the difference
2. if you have the exact same problem add a like (:+1:)
3. otherwise create a new issue

### Bugs

When facing a bug, give steps to reproduce as well as the error. If you have a
hypothesis to why this issue erupted, mention this. If you have already isolated
the issue and have found a fix, you can open a PR.

When you have a problem, these steps will often help:

- Make sure you use the latest version of Deno
- Add the `-r` or `--reload` flag to the Deno command to reload the cache

### Ideas

Ideas are always welcome, and if there is a good reason and/or many users agree,
there is a good chance it will be incorporated. Before making a PR, get feedback
from the maintainers and comunity.

### Questions

If you can't find the answers in one of the open (or closed) issues, create a
new one. If this project gains enough traction, a discord server will be
created, until then you can use the issues.

## When creating a PR

Before pushing commits, go through this checklist:

- You have run `deno fmt`
- All tests are running successfully

For a PR to be accepted, the following needs to be applied:

- Add tests where applicable
- Pipeline is green
- Nothing more than what the PR is supposed to solve is changed (unless
  discussed and approved)

## Testing

Run `deno test`
